# Graphviz_C_sharp

The goal of this project is educational. 

This is a really simple set of functions that I made to create a graphviz file from a binary tree in c#.

It could use a lot of improvements and I would like to use it to also make graph data structures into pictures as well.

Todo: implement a red black tree in c#
